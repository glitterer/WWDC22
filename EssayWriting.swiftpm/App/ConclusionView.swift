This is shown by the scene of the protagonist reminiscing about the past and going into a delusion of catching the fragrance of hope in finding his ideal happiness in the future. Like the Kung-Fu Panda, if one is stuck in the past, he is unable to see the present, and without being able to see the present, it is difficult to move forward. The only way Panda successfully masters martial arts is by understanding and accepting the present. This is not only applied to protagonists of movies and stories but also our real lives. Without being able to see the present, it is impossible to find happiness in the future. Therefore, it is important to explore the inner-happiness of the current time and space rather than seeking it in the past or the future.").font(.custom("Helvetica", size:25)).foregroundColor(.black).padding().lineSpacing(10).multilineTextAlignment(.leading))
